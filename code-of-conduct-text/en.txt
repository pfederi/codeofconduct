# Pumpfoilers' Code of Conduct

We – the Swiss pumpfoil community – recognize pumpfoiling as an exciting and demanding sport that requires skill, practice, and respect for the water and environment. Safety, responsibility, and good sportsmanship are key to enjoying the sport while protecting ourselves, others, and our waters.

Therefore, we pledge to follow these principles and guidelines whenever we pumpfoil:

## 1. Safety First

We prioritize safety – for ourselves and others. That means being aware of our surroundings, adapting to conditions, and choosing spots and maneuvers responsibly to avoid dangerous situations.

## 2. Respect for the Environment

We respect the water as a fragile ecosystem and commit to protecting it by avoiding littering, pollution, and disturbing wildlife.

## 3. Responsible Behavior

We take responsiblity of how we show up on the water. This includes respecting others, acting with consideration, and recognizing that our behavior shapes the public perception of pumpfoiling.

## 4. Consideration for Others

We respect other water users and commit to keeping a safe distance from swimmers and watercraft, using clear signals to communicate, and waiting our turn when the waters are crowded.

## 5. Compliance with Regulations

We are aware that local regulations may apply to pumpfoiling. We strive to stay informed and behave in a way that is respectful of local conditions and communities.

## 6. Fun and Sportsmanship

We embrace pumpfoiling as a fun and social activity that unites our community, and we commit to enjoying it with enthusiasm, respect, and good sportsmanship – supporting each other and sharing our knowledge and passion.

By following these principles, we promote pumpfoiling as a safe, responsible, and sustainable sport that respects the water, the environment, and fellow enthusiasts.

We invite all pumpfoilers to join us in this commitment and share the Pumpfoiling Code of Conduct. If someone is disturbed by our behavior or approaches us, we remain open, respectful, and seek direct conversation – this creates understanding and good cooperation on the water.

**Let's pumpfoil with confidence, respect, and joy!**
